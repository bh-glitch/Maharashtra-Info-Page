            <span style="font-size: 16px; padding: 10px 0;">
                Before India gained Independence, Maharashtra was ruled by the Satavahana dynasty, Deccan sultanates, Mughals, Marathas and British. 
                 The British gained total control of the state after the Third Anglo-Maratha War, where they defeated Peshwa Bajirao II. The British ruled for more than a century and brought along immense changes in the lifestyle of the people living in Maharashtra region. 
                After Indian Independence was gained, the princely states and Jagirs of the Deccan States Agency were merged into Bombay State.

                Most people here speak the native language Marathi but the most common spoken language is Hindi, with presence of so many people from different states, the state can be called a multi-lingual state.
                When it comes to attire, traditionally women wore and still wear the attested nine-yard long sari, but with the modernization we often find women and girls dressed in western outfits. On the other hand among men the western dressing has a greater acceptance but on occasions the traditional dhoti and pheta, commonly known as kurta is worn by them. The Gandhi cap is the popular apparel in rural Maharashtra.
